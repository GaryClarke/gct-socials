When you build Go programs, you will often want to use code written by other developers. This might be a library that generates unique IDs, sends HTTP requests, handles colours in the terminal, or anything else you might need.

Go manages external dependencies through modules. Use go get to install packages. Once installed, import the package using the same path. Go handles downloading, caching, and tracking dependencies automatically.
