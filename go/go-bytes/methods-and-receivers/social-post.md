Methods in Go let you attach functions to types. The receiver is the part in parentheses before the function name. It tells Go which type owns the method.

The receiver syntax keeps related behaviour close to your data. Instead of passing a Rectangle to a function, you call rect.Area() directly. It reads naturally and keeps your code organised.

Methods are functions with receivers. The receiver gives the method access to the type's data, so you can write functions that operate on specific types. You call methods using dot syntax, just like accessing struct fields.

This pattern becomes important as your programs grow. When you have multiple actions for a type, methods keep everything together. They're also the foundation for pointer receivers and interfaces, which you'll use in more advanced Go code.
