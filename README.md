### By Lesson
Each lesson has its own folder containing:

- `graphic.png` - Associated visual (when available)

## üì± Content Format

Each social post file contains:
1. **LinkedIn version** (top) - Longer, educational content
2. **Twitter version** (bottom) - Shorter, punchy content
3. **Separated by**: `============ Tweet =============`

## üéØ Finding Specific Content

### By Topic
Use GitHub's search to find content by topic:
- Search for "testing" to find testing-related posts
- Search for "handlers" to find Go handler content
- Search for "polymorphism" to find OOP content

### By Status
- Look for `status: drafted` for upcoming content
- Look for `status: posted` for published content
- Look for `status: scheduled` for planned content
