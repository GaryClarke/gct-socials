Break and continue give you more control over loops in Go. Break stops the loop completely. Continue skips the rest of the current iteration and moves on to the next one.

Use break when you want to stop looping entirely, like when you find what you're looking for. Use continue when you want to skip certain values but keep the loop running.

Both keywords help reduce nested if statements and make your intent clearer. They work in all forms of for loops, giving you fine-grained control over loop execution.
