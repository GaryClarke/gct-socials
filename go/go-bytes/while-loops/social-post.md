Go does not have a while keyword. Instead, for handles all looping patterns, including while-style loops. A while-style loop runs as long as a condition is true, and Go expresses this with a for loop that contains only a condition. This keeps the language simple and consistent while still allowing all the patterns you are used to.

You can also create infinite loops by writing for with no condition at all. These loops run forever unless you use break to exit them. The break statement immediately stops the loop, and continue skips to the next iteration. These control flow statements work in all loop types, giving you precise control over loop behaviour.

Go doesn't have a while keyword, so...use for + condition for while-style loops. 
for with no condition creates infinite loops - use break to exit. 
continue skips to the next iteration. 

All loop patterns use for.
