Switch statements in Go are cleaner than long if/else chains. You can match multiple values in one case, and Go automatically stops after the first match. No break statements needed.

What I like about Go's switch is how readable it makes decision logic. Instead of nested if/else blocks, you get a clear list of cases. Plus, you can check multiple values at once by separating them with commas.

If you're writing code that needs to handle several different values, switch is usually the better choice. It's easier to read and easier to maintain.
