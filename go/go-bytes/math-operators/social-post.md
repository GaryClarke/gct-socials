Go treats integers and floats differently when you divide values. Integer operands drop the fractional part, so 7/3 becomes 2. Convert to float64 when you need the decimal portion. This tiny habit keeps your calculations predictable.

I like how explicit Go is. The compiler forces you to think about types, and that nudges you into clearer code. It’s the difference between a silent bug and a clean result.

In Go, integer division drops the decimals: 7/3 == 2. Convert to float64 when you need 2.3333333333333335. Types matter. Follow me for more Go bytes.
