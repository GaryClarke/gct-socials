Go won't automatically convert types for you, and that's actually helpful. It prevents bugs from hidden type changes. The syntax is simple: TypeName(value). Convert ints to floats, floats to ints, strings to bytes.

I like how explicit it is. You see exactly what's happening, and the compiler catches type mismatches before your code runs. It's one of those small design choices that makes Go code more predictable.

Go requires explicit type conversions: TypeName(value). No automatic conversions means fewer bugs. Convert ints to floats, strings to bytes, and see exactly what's happening.
