Go variadic functions let you write flexible functions that accept any number of arguments. Use the ... syntax before the parameter type, and inside the function that parameter becomes a slice you can loop over.

This is useful for functions like sum, where you want to add together however many numbers are passed in, without having to create a slice manually when calling the function.

You will see variadic functions throughout the Go standard library, in functions like fmt.Println and append. Understanding them helps you recognise and use these patterns confidently.
