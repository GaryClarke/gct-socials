Pointers in Go surprise a lot of newcomers. They’re simply variables that hold an address, so you can update data without copying it. Take the address with &, then dereference with * when you want the value.

I like them because they make your code honest about where data lives. No magic, no guessing whether something is copied. Isolate the pointer, read the value, update it deliberately.

Go pointers store addresses. Take an address with &, use * to read or update the value. That’s it. Follow me for more Go bytes.
