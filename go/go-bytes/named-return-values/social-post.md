Go allows you to give names to your return values right in the function signature. When you use named returns, Go creates variables with those names when the function begins, so you can assign to them directly and use a bare return statement to send them back.

Named returns can make functions easier to read when there are multiple results or when results are built gradually. They are especially useful when the meaning of each return value is clear from the name.

Use them carefully though. If you find yourself searching through the function to understand what is being returned, a simple explicit return might be clearer.
