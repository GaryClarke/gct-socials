Go maps store key-value pairs. You create them, read values by key, and add or update entries on the fly. They're flexible and fast for lookups, which makes them perfect for config, settings, or organizing small datasets.

Unlike structs, maps don't need a type definition upfront. Just declare the key and value types, add your data, and you're set. Simple and useful when you need dynamic data structures.
