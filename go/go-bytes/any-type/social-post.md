Go is a statically typed language, which means every variable has a clear and specific type. Most of the time this is exactly what you want, because it helps catch mistakes early and makes code easier to understand.

Sometimes, though, you need a variable or a function that can work with values of any type. Go provides a special built in type for this situation: any.

The any type is an alias for interface{} and lets you work with values of any type. You can use it as a function parameter to accept different types of inputs, or as a map value type to store strings, integers, floats, and other types all in the same map. This flexibility is especially useful when working with JSON data or configuration settings, but use it thoughtfully because it removes some of the type safety that makes Go code reliable.

Go's any type lets you work with values of any type. Use it as a function parameter or as a map value type to store mixed types. Useful for JSON data or config, but use it thoughtfully.
