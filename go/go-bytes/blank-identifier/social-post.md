In Go, if you declare a variable and don't use it, the compiler throws an error. That's Go being helpful... but sometimes you genuinely don't need a value.

Enter the blank identifier: a single underscore that tells Go "I know this value exists, but I'm choosing to ignore it."

You'll see it most often in range loops when you only need the value and not the index. It's part of Go's philosophy of explicit code: handle every value, even if that means intentionally ignoring it.

Go's blank identifier (underscore) lets you ignore values you don't need. Common in range loops when you only want the value, not the index.
