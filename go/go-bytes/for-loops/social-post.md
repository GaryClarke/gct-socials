Go uses a single keyword for all loops: for. Whether you're counting, iterating over slices, or repeating an action, it's all the same keyword. This keeps things simple.

With a counter loop, you control how many times something runs. With range, you let Go handle each item in a slice automatically. Both patterns show up constantly in real code, so getting comfortable with them early pays off.
