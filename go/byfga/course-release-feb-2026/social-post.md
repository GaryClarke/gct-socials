Build Your First Go App is for anyone new to Go who wants to learn by building something real. You build an API from scratch: handlers, routing, SQLite, validation, and tests. The course uses idiomatic Go and common patterns so you're not just copying code, you're understanding how and why.

It's live now. Subscriber discount and lesson previews are in the comments so you can try before you buy. If you've been meaning to get into Go, this is a good place to start.
