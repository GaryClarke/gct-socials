Go slices are flexible lists that grow with your data. You can start small, add more as you go, and keep your code simple and readable. This is why slices are the default choice for collections in Go.

If you’re coming from another language, think of slices like lists backed by arrays. You count items with len, add items with append, and pass slices around without fuss. It feels natural, and it keeps everyday tasks tidy.
