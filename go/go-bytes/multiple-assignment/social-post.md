Go lets you swap two values in a single line without a temporary variable. Multiple assignment evaluates all right-hand expressions first, then assigns them to the left side. This makes operations like swapping safe and straightforward.

Multiple assignment is also the standard way to capture multiple return values from functions, which is common in Go. It helps keep your code concise and readable while maintaining clarity.
