I've put together a course for anyone who's new to Go and wants to learn by building something real. Build Your First Go App walks you through building an app using idiomatic Go and common practices so you're not just copying code, you're understanding how and why.

It's out on Friday 27th January. Subscriber discount and lesson previews available...check the comments 👇. If you've been meaning to get into Go, this is a good place to start.
