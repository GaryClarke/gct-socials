Testing Laravel is now live.

After months of working on this course, I'm excited to share it with you. This course focuses on testing real features that you'd actually build in a Laravel app.

We cover testing form submissions, CSV uploads, queued jobs, and HTTP requests to third-party services. The kind of stuff that matters when you're shipping real applications.

Each lesson is driven by actual scenarios. We test a subscription form that sends real emails, then move on to bulk CSV processing with background jobs. No toy examples.

You'll learn how Laravel's testing tools make this stuff straightforward. Queue::fake() for testing jobs without running them. Mail::fake() for checking emails without sending them. HTTP::fake() for mocking API calls.

The course has 40+ video lessons, all the code examples, and lifetime access. If you've been putting off testing because it seems complicated, this course shows you how to approach it properly.
