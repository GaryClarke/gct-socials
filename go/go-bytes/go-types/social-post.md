Go's type system catches bugs before your program runs and makes your code predictable.

Every value in Go has a type. You can let Go figure out the type automatically with `:=` or be explicit with `var`. Both approaches work, but understanding when to use each one helps you write clearer code.

What I like about Go's approach is that it's strict but not restrictive. You can't accidentally mix incompatible types, which prevents a whole class of bugs. But the type inference means you don't have to write verbose type declarations everywhere.

If you're new to Go, getting comfortable with these basic types early makes everything else easier to learn.
