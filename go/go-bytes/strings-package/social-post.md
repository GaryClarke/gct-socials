Go's strings package provides useful functions you'll use a lot when working with text. Functions like strings.Contains, strings.HasPrefix, and strings.HasSuffix return booleans, making them perfect for validation checks like checking if an email contains an @ symbol or if a filename ends with .txt.

The strings package also includes functions for transforming text like strings.ToUpper, strings.ToLower, and strings.TrimSpace. These are common operations you'll need when processing user input, cleaning data, or validating filenames and commands.
