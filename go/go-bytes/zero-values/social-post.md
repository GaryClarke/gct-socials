In Go, every variable gets a value, even if you don't assign one. Uninitialized ints get 0, strings get empty string, bools get false. This predictable behavior means you can always rely on variables having a known state.

I like how Go avoids undefined behavior. Instead of throwing errors or leaving memory uninitialized, you get safe defaults. It's one of those small features that prevents a lot of bugs.

In Go, uninitialized variables get zero values: int gets 0, string gets empty, bool gets false. Predictable defaults prevent bugs. Follow me for more Go bytes.
