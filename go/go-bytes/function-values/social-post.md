In Go, functions are values just like numbers or strings. You can assign them to variables and call them through those variables.

This is a powerful feature that many languages support, and Go is one of them. Understanding how function values work in Go opens the door to more flexible code patterns, callbacks, and functional-style techniques.

The syntax is straightforward: assign a function to a variable, then call it. This lets you swap behaviour at runtime and pass functions around like any other value.
