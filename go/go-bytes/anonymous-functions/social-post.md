In Go, functions do not always need a name. You can create functions inline and use them directly. These are called anonymous functions or function literals.

They are useful when you need a small piece of behaviour that is only used in one place. Anonymous functions help keep code close to where it is used and avoid creating extra named functions.

You can assign them to variables, pass them around, or call them immediately. They can take parameters and return values just like named functions.
