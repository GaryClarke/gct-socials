Go gives you three ways to format strings, and each has its place. fmt.Println is simple, fmt.Printf gives you control with format verbs, and fmt.Sprintf builds strings you can use elsewhere.

I like fmt.Sprintf because it separates building the message from printing it. You can format once, reuse the string in logs, responses, or wherever you need it. The format verbs like %s and %d make your intent clear.

Go has three string formatters: fmt.Println (simple), fmt.Printf (control), fmt.Sprintf (returns string). Format verbs like %s and %d give you precise control.
