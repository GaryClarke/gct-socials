Go arrays are fixed-size collections of the same type. Perfect for when you know exactly how many items you need.

You declare the size upfront: [3]int means exactly 3 integers. Access elements by index (starting at 0), and use len() to get the array size.

Arrays are zero-indexed, so the first element is at index 0, not 1...which is consistent across Go and most programming languages.
