Go raw strings keep every character exactly as you type it. Backticks skip escape sequences, so `\n` stays `\n` and multi-line blocks keep their shape. Handy for JSON, SQL, or long error messages.

The best part: readability. You can drop a snippet straight into your code without double escaping quotes or worrying about formatting. It’s a tiny feature that saves a lot of friction.
