Go functions can return multiple values. It's built into the language and shows up everywhere in Go code.

Instead of forcing separate function calls or complex return structures, you return related values together in one call. List the return types in parentheses after your function parameters, then unpack them into multiple variables when you call the function.

This keeps your code simple and makes the intent clear. You'll see this pattern throughout Go's standard library and in real applications.
