Polymorphism isn't magic. It's just using a shared interface and calling methods dynamically.

Let your code depend on abstractions, not implementations.

When you write code that uses interfaces instead of concrete types, you're practicing polymorphism. This makes your code more flexible and easier to test.

Instead of checking types with `instanceof`, use interfaces. Your code becomes cleaner and more maintainable.

This is the kind of practical OOP we cover in my Object-Oriented PHP course.
