When you have a slice and need to pass its elements into a variadic function, you cannot pass the slice directly. Go treats it as a single value, which causes a compile error.

The ellipsis operator (...) expands a slice so each element is passed as an individual argument. This lets you use existing slices with variadic functions and forward variadic arguments from one function to another.
