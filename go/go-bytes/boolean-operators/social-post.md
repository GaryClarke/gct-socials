Go boolean operators let you combine conditions. && checks if both are true, || checks if at least one is true. Parentheses control the order of evaluation, which is important when mixing operators. This example shows loggedIn AND (isStaff OR hasPermission) - the parentheses ensure the OR is evaluated first, then the result is combined with the AND.

Understanding operator precedence and grouping helps you write clear, correct logic. It's one of those things that trips people up, but once you see it, it clicks.
