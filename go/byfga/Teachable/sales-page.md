- **Body text:** This course takes you from zero to building your first complete Go application. You'll learn essential Go concepts by building a real-world project that brings together everything you need to know about the language.

What you'll learn are the core Go concepts that every Go developer needs: writing idiomatic Go code, structuring projects properly, working with handlers, using all the different Go types, modeling requests with structs, validation, organizing code with packages, building Go binaries, and running Go servers.

Each lesson builds on the previous one, so you'll see how all the pieces fit together into a cohesive project. You'll piece together all the concepts taught in Go Bytes into one complete application.

We cover things like:
- Writing idiomatic Go code and following best practices
- Structuring Go projects the right way
- Working with handlers and HTTP servers
- Using all different Go types effectively
- Modeling requests with structs
- Validation and error handling
- Organizing code with Go packages

### Section 12: Example Video 1

**Content:**
- **Lesson Name:** Spinning up an HTTP Server
- **Description:** In this one, we're gonna transform your simple Go program into a real web server. You'll learn how to create an HTTP server that can handle incoming requests and send responses back to clients. This is where your Go program becomes something that can actually serve web content and API endpoints.

**Instructions:**
- Use Video block in Teachable
- Upload the video file from lesson 3
- Add "Spinning up an HTTP Server" as a heading (usually H4 or H5)
- Use the introduction paragraph as description

---

### Section 13: Example Video 2

**Content:**
- **Lesson Name:** Writing Json Response Content
- **Description:** In this one, we're gonna learn how to send JSON responses from your Go HTTP handlers instead of plain text. You'll discover how to use Go's built-in `encoding/json` package to convert your Go data structures into JSON format that clients can easily parse. This is essential for building modern APIs that communicate with web applications, mobile apps, and other services.

**Instructions:**
- Use Video block in Teachable
- Upload the video file from lesson 6
- Add "Writing Json Response Content" as a heading (usually H4 or H5)
- Use the introduction paragraph as description

---

### Section 14: Example Video 3

**Content:**
- **Lesson Name:** Modelling Books with Structs

You'll learn how to use the `omitempty` directive in JSON tags to control exactly which fields appear in your JSON responses when they're empty. This is important for building clean APIs where you only send relevant data to clients.

**Instructions:**
- Use Video block in Teachable
- Upload the video file from lesson 9
- Add "Modelling Books with Structs" as a heading (usually H4 or H5)

This is a common approach in API development - get your endpoint working with example data first, then wire it up to the real data source later.

**Instructions:**
- Use Video block in Teachable
- Upload the video file from lesson 10
- Add "List Books Handler" as a heading (usually H4 or H5)

### Section 17: FAQs

**Content:**

**Q.** Is this course beginner-friendly?

**A.** Yes! This course assumes you're brand new to Go. We start from the very beginning with setting up Go modules and build up to a complete application. Each lesson builds on the previous one, so you'll always understand what's happening.

**Q.** What exactly do we build in the course?

**Q.** How does this relate to Go Bytes?

**A.** Go Bytes teaches individual Go concepts in bite-sized videos. This course takes all those concepts and glues them together into a real, complete application. You'll see how everything fits together using idiomatic Go code and proper project structure - building something you'd actually use in production.

**Q.** Is this just theory, or do we write real code?

**A.** It's 100% hands-on. You'll write real Go code in every lesson, building a working application from scratch. No dry theory - every concept is demonstrated through actual code you'll write yourself.

**Q.** Will I have lifetime access?

**A.** Yes, your one-time payment gives you permanent access to the course - including all future updates. No subscriptions. No upsells. Just everything you need in one place.

**Q.** Who is this course for?

**A.** Anyone who wants to learn Go by building a real application. Whether you're new to Go or want to understand how to structure Go projects properly, this course will give you the foundation you need.

Since then, my videos have been watched over a million times. I’m still teaching every day, covering PHP, Go, and everything I’ve learned building real-world applications. My goal is to help you move faster by sharing the patterns and workflows that actually work. It would be my pleasure to see you on the inside of this course.
