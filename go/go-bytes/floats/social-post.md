Go gives you two float types, and the precision difference matters. Float32 stores about 7 decimal digits, while float64 stores about 15. That extra precision prevents rounding errors in calculations.

I default to float64 because modern hardware handles it efficiently, and the precision is usually worth the small memory cost. Use float32 only when memory is tight or you're working with large arrays where every byte counts.

Go float32 stores about 7 decimal digits, float64 stores about 15. The precision difference prevents rounding errors. Default to float64 unless memory is tight.
