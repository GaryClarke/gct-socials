Go makes concurrency simple. Add the go keyword before a function call, and it runs concurrently instead of blocking.

Goroutines are lightweight units of execution managed by the Go runtime. They run independently of the code that starts them, allowing you to perform multiple tasks at the same time without dealing with threads directly.

This is Go's approach to concurrency. One keyword changes how your program behaves.
